# PacMan
My capstone project from college.
To start the game, run the "bossmenu.py" file. This is my "PacMan in Python" capstone project for Plymouth State. It's been a while since working on this project so I may have uploaded a few unnecessary files. I will go through these and delete redundant files when I get the chance.
I am most proud of the grid system I used with nodes that keep tabs on PacMan's location. This is how the ghosts know where to find you at all times. There's a node in each intersection that, when in contact with PacMan, take note of the current location. Each ghost has it's own algorithm to find the right path to get to the player. Not all ghosts take the shortest path, some try to flank PacMan.
